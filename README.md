ES-config
=========

A flexible tool for configuring multiple emulators simultaneously.

Building
========

You'll need these dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev
```

You'll also need [AngelScript](http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/downloads.html), which is inconveniently absent from the Debian repositories!
At the time of writing, the latest version is 2.26.1, available [here](http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/sdk/files/angelscript_2.26.1.zip).

I haven't set up a Makefile yet!
